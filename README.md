Grammar as a Service

This module builds and converts sentences into a better grammatical form. It provides the output in plain text, HTML, and SSML for voice applications. The verbal nature of SSML means that generated sentences often sounded bad unless the grammar was correct, and was this code's original purpose.

The output also provides a "teachme" section to explain the changes.


# Background

This was a proprietary product used in a number of Alexa skills, but the code has now been opened for general usage. Consequently, there are several rough edges as only the necessary components were written - and often in haste!
